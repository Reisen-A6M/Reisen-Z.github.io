<p>Race: Moon rabbit</p>

<p>Residence: Eternal Pavilion</p>

<p>Ability: the ability to manipulate the level of rage</p>

<h3 id="markdown">Waves</h3>

<p>Light is made up of waves - though common sense at first glance, this alone cannot be called a comprehensive perspective.</p>

<p>Space itself is a wave, in which the existence of biological, material, of course, also contains light, are composed of waves.</p>

<p>Of course, biological thinking and feelings are also made up of waves. It is because of different wavelengths that different individuals have different personalities.</p>

<p>Reisen's ability is to manipulate these waves.</p>

<p>If you make the wavelength shorter, you will become crazy; if you make the wavelength longer, you will become calm.</p>

<p>And if it is completely reversed... She will disappear from all the perception of her opponent, and her existence will become imperceptible.</p>

<h3 id="jekyll-themes">Characteristics</h3>

<p>Craziness and leisure coexist. (Obessessionor) The characteristics are completely different in combat and in daily lives.</p>

<p>Because it is not a living thing on the ground, it seldom cooperates with human beings. Don't be surprised when she changes the characteristics quickly.</p>

<p>Although Reisen is not gentle at all, it occasionally shows a leisurely side similar to Reimu.</p>
